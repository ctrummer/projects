This demo project demonstrates the usage of Google Guice (pronounced as "Juice") framework and its
dependency injection (DI) and aspect oriented programming (AOP) capabilities.

Starting points for demo: Application.java in com.ssp.demo.guice.projects.customerOne, 
customerTwo and customerThree packages.

Customer One and Two are simply for demonstrating the DI, Customer Three for demonstrating
the DI _and_ the AOP.
